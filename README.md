# ML-pH-Prediction-Based-On-Solution
Built a linear regression model to predict solution pH from conductivity and temperature data. Trained on a clean 1,000‑sample dataset, achieving reliable performance (MAE: 1.19). Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit‑learn, offering a fast, cost‑effective alternative to traditional pH measurement methods.
